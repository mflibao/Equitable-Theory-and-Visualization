Equitable Coloring of Pan–Path Graphs: Theory and Visualization for Mathematics Education

This repository provides the supplementary material for the paper Equitable Coloring of Pan–Path Graphs: Theory and Visualization for Mathematics Education. It contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates equitable coloring of pan graphs and their Cartesian product with paths. The notebook includes graph builders, equitable coloring functions, interactive animations, and snapshot generation, making it a valuable tool for both researchers and educators in discrete mathematics.
